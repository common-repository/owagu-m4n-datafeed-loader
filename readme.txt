= What are the limitations ? =

This free version is a scaled down version of the fully loaded commercial version. People that are thinking of purchasing the commercial version are strongly advised to try this free version first to see if their server supports our settings. This particular free version is geared towards m4n datafeeds only.

= How do I start ? =

READ STUFF !! The plugin should be fairly straightforward and has a lot of built in tips/help.

= What should I NOT do ? =

Do not immediately try to upload a 3 Megabyte datafeed with 200.000 articles. Test first with a small feed.
